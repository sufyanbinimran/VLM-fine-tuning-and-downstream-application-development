> Fine-tuning Visual-Language Models (VLM) for Crime Scene Investigation üö®  
> Developed by **Muhammad Sufyan Malik**

## üìñ Overview

**CID AI** is an advanced Crime Scene Investigation system powered by deep learning and large language models (LLMs).  
It combines **fine-tuned vision models** and **Gemini LLM** to **analyze crime scene images** and **generate detailed investigation reports**.

üöî Workflow:  
- Fine-tuned **BLIP** model creates **detailed descriptions** of images.
- Descriptions are passed to **Gemini 1.5 Pro** for **reasoning, evidence analysis, and report generation**.

> üí° Think of it as an AI-powered **Sherlock Holmes** ‚Äî analyzing images & generating professional crime scene investigations!

| Fine-tuned BLIP Model | [HuggingFace: `sufyanbinimran/blip-finetuned`](https://huggingface.co/sufyanbinimran/blip-finetuned/commit/85ef4f8a8816b6bd4a773af421853ca5b1bcacaf) |

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

1. **Upload an Image** ‚Äî Any scene, object, or suspected crime scene.
2. **BLIP Fine-tuned Model** generates an **image caption** (description).
3. **Gemini LLM** analyzes the scene description using an investigation prompt.
4. **Investigation Report** is generated detailing:
   - Possible crime evidence
   - Suspects (if any)
   - Logical reasoning steps

## üìö Dataset Used for Fine-Tuning

We fine-tuned BLIP on a **filtered dataset** combining:

- **Flickr8K** ‚Äî 8,000+ images, 5 captions per image  
  > [Kaggle Flickr8k Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityajn105/flickr8k)

- **COCO-100K (Subset)** ‚Äî 10,000+ image-caption pairs  
  > [COCO Dataset Official Site](https://cocodataset.org/#download)

**Purpose of Fine-tuning:**  
- Focus BLIP more on **scene understanding** rather than just objects.
- Prepare captions that are **suitable for forensic analysis**.

## üöÄ Local Installation (Optional)

To run it locally:

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/sufyanbinimran/VLM-fine-tuning-and-downstream-application-development.git
cd VLM-fine-tuning-and-downstream-application-development

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run Streamlit app
streamlit run app.py
```

**Dependencies:**
- `transformers`
- `huggingface_hub`
- `torch`
- `streamlit`
- `Pillow`
- `google-generativeai`

Make sure to set your **Gemini API key** inside `app.py`.
